# 🧪 Loss Submission Test Guide

## ✅ **Bug Fixed & Tested**

### **Previous Issue:**
The system was blocking negative amounts (losses) due to validation bug in `utils.py`.

### **✅ Fix Applied:**
- Updated `validate_amount()` to accept negative values for losses
- Added `validate_investment_amount()` to ensure investments remain positive
- Updated error messages for clarity

### **🧪 Validation Test Results:**
```
Testing profit validation:
✅ Positive 100: 100.0      (accepts profits)
✅ Negative -50: -50.0      (accepts losses) 
✅ Decimal -25.75: -25.75   (accepts decimal losses)

Testing investment validation:
✅ Positive 100: 100.0      (accepts investments)
✅ Negative -50: None       (correctly rejects negative investments)
✅ Zero 0: None             (correctly rejects zero investments)
```
