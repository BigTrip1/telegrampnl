## 🔧 **Important Notes**

### **✅ DO:**
- **Upload clear screenshots** - Required for all submissions
- **Use negative numbers for losses** - Example: -100, -50.25
- **Be honest about trades** - Transparency builds trust
- **Submit only in PnLs topic** - Auto-detection only works there
- **Use exact profit/loss amounts** - Don't estimate

### **❌ DON'T:**
- **Upload fake screenshots** - Community values honesty
- **Exaggerate profits** - Stick to actual numbers
- **Submit same trade twice** - One submission per trade
- **Use positive numbers for losses** - Always use minus sign
- **Submit in wrong topics** - Bot ignores photos outside PnLs topic

### **💡 Pro Tips:**
- **For losses:** ALWAYS use negative numbers (-50, -100, -25.75)
- **For profits:** Use positive numbers (50, 100, 25.75)
- **Screenshot timing:** Take screenshot immediately after trade
- **Decimal places:** Supported (25.50, 150.75, etc.)
- **Large numbers:** Use regular format (1000, not 1,000)

---

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### **"Invalid amount" Error**
**Problem:** Bot says your amount is invalid
**Solutions:**
- ✅ Use numbers only (100, not $100)
- ✅ Use minus sign for losses (-50)
- ✅ Use decimal point (25.50, not 25,50)
- ✅ Check for typos

### **"Investment must be positive" Error**
**Problem:** Bot rejects your investment amount
**Solutions:**
- ✅ Investment amounts must be positive
- ✅ Use: 100, 250.50, 1000
- ❌ Don't use: -100, 0, $100

### **Bot Doesn't Respond to Screenshot**
**Problem:** Upload photo but bot doesn't ask to submit
**Solutions:**
- ✅ Make sure you're in **PnLs topic** (11248)
- ✅ Wait 5-10 seconds after upload
- ✅ Try uploading again
- ✅ Use `/submit` command as alternative

### **Lost Session**
**Problem:** Process interrupted mid-submission
**Solutions:**
- ✅ Type `/cancel` to reset
- ✅ Start fresh with new screenshot upload
- ✅ Wait a few minutes and try again
